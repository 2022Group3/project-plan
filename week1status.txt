First week status:

✔What we have done:
  *Create csv file for cfar10 and 1 super class from cfar100
   with cols: (image name, batch label, label number, label name, dataset(from cfar10 or cfar100..., train/validation/test)
   
  *A class with a few statistics about the data distribution (size,disribution by train/validation/test, disribution by class...)
  
  *A class that displays a single image and samples of each class.
  
  *Change format of different images to match our data.
  
  
 ❓questions:
 
 *Should the images be unpickeld and saved as real images on the computer, and in csv save path to those images
  or leave them as pickels and every time when you access them you send them to a function which displays it and turns it into an image?
  
 * Should the path be saved in csv or find it by concating batch label, image name...
 
 *The data was already devided into train and test, but no validations. 
  Should we devide it again with the validation or use the original division?
  
 *We had collected different new images on our own for testing our model.
  We where debating if to add them to the data csv with labels and all the rest, or leaving them for the end, to see how the model works?
  
  *what to do with the format of the images:
  to do manipulation for the image to change it to square
  
  *should the train,test,validation has to be static and saved in the csv or has to be dinamic and devide it.
